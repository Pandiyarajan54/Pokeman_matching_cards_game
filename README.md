## Optimizations

In addition, you can add/remove rows and columns to give the game varying difficulty. In this project, we don't make a check to see if the user has flipped all the cards since it is a trivial task, but you can add a check to see if all cards are matched. To do so, you would create an int variable to increment every time the player gets a match. Another feature you can add is a stopwatch feature to see how fast you can match all the cards. For more of a challenge, you can add an option for a 2 player version where you alternate between 2 players on the same computer to see who gets the most matches. If a player gets a match, they will be allowed to go again.
